# x6100
This repository contain customized GUI for Xiegu X6100. 

Changes for both versions:
- VOL/multi buttons - background to gray, text to white, left line 1px
- AGC-F indicator - changed from yellow to white
- background for VFO B - changed to gray
- VFO A and B indicator - removed borders

For using this file, please download requested version, rename file to x6100_ui_v100 and via SCP or SD card replace the original file in /usr/app_qt/ on your device. Then reboot the rig.

You can use GUI 1.1.5 with base 1.1.6. The radio will act based on 1.1.6 base (e.g. SQL for FM will not work) but with old GUI. 

If there will be any issues, you can just simply reflash with original firmware to return back stock image.
